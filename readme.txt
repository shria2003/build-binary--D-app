HI, this is Shreeya, 
Recently i have been interested in making 3D visualizer web/app that will visualize binary trees. The goal of the concept is for educational purpose. To understand a certain topic, we may find that certain topic goes too deep with lots of differentiating and definition and thus leads us to forgetfullness even after making notes. To earadicate my/your problem, i have come up with a solution that will visually guide and summarize you the topic after making the binary/tertiary tree on it.
this how it should look like:

								main topic
								     |
							------------------------
							|		       |
						topic 2.1		topic 2.2
							|			|
					---------------------		    ---------------------
					|		    |		   |			|
				topic 2.1.1		topic2.1.2        ... 			...
				(if zoomed in)
					|
				def,differences,e.g.,videos etc
				{make it 3d}

										

The skeleton has been given , contribute your knowledge and please make it happen 




Build binary trees in 3d app

Choose a programming language: You can use any language that supports 3D graphics, such as JavaScript, Python, or Java. For this example, we will use JavaScript.

Set up the environment: You will need a development environment such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text, along with a web browser to view the app.

Create the binary tree: Write code to generate the binary tree, which consists of nodes with left and right children. Each node will have a value associated with it. You can create the tree recursively or iteratively, depending on your preference.

Create a 3D environment: Use a library such as Three.js or Babylon.js to create a 3D environment in the browser. This will allow you to add objects such as spheres and lines to represent the nodes and connections of the tree.

Render the tree in 3D: Write code to render the binary tree in the 3D environment. For each node in the tree, create a sphere to represent it, and draw lines between the spheres to represent the connections between nodes.

Add interactivity: Add interactivity to the app, such as the ability to rotate the view, zoom in and out, and highlight specific nodes.

Test and refine: Test the app and refine it as necessary, adding features such as different color schemes, animation, or the ability to dynamically add nodes to the tree.


With these steps, you can create a 3D app to visualize binary trees in a fun and interactive way. Good luck!
